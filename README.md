# intern-we3-webgl-gallery

Welcome WE3 devs!

Interactive and realtime artworks have become very popular with the rise of NFT's. Platforms now give artists the ability to sell their creations for crypto currency.

For your starting project we would like you to create a WebGL gallery website.

This project can be broke down in two tasks:

1. Create the website interface

* Create an index page which shows thumbnails of each artwork with a text description.
* Create a gallery page which showcases each of your indivisual artworks example: `/gallery/artwork-1` `/gallery/artwork-2` etc

Please use the Jam3 [nextjs boilerplate](https://github.com/Jam3/nextjs-boilerplate) as the framework.
  
2. Creating the artworks:

We encourage you to use whichever web technology your interested in or want to learn. 

Some popular libraries include:

 * [threejs](https://threejs.org/)
 * [p5js](https://p5js.org/)
 * [pixijs](https://www.pixijs.com/)
 
We recommend you spending at least half a day thinking about what artwork you would like to create, why it's important and which technology is right to execute it.

-----------------------------------

How to get the project running with the nextjs boilerplate:
  * do not use the latest version of node! v14.16.1 is guaranteed to work, recommendation is to stick with a 14 or 15.
  * you can use `nvm` to install and switch so for example if you're using the same version as me then go to the command line tool and `nvm install v14.16.1` then type `nvm use v14.16.1`
  * once you got that covered, `npm install`
  * `npm run dev`
  * launch chrome in [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  * make sure you have ESLint set up too
  * if you run into problems with linter warnings, add the `--no-verify` flag at the end of your git commit command. (especially for push and commit)
   
  good luck <3
UPDATE FOR THREE.JS:
Please avoid using specific modules such as GUI controls in this project it is unsuported. 
If it gives you a warning that it needs a GSAP module then we can talk about it.
